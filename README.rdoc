= Rack::API

Create web app APIs that respond to one or more formats using an elegant DSL.

== Installation

  gem install rack-api

== Usage

=== Basic example

  Rack::API.app do
    prefix "api"

    version :v1 do
      get "users(.:format)" do
        User.all
      end

      get "users/:id(.:format)" do
        User.find(params[:id])
      end
    end
  end

=== Rails Integration

First, set up your Gemfile like this:

  gem "rack-api", "~> 0.1.0", :require => "rack/api"

Create your API somewhere. In this example, we'll add it to <tt>lib/api.rb</tt>.

  Rack::API.app do
    prefix "api"

    version :v1 do
      get "status(.:format)" do
        {:success => true, :time => Time.now}
      end
    end
  end

Load this file somehow. I'd create a <tt>config/initializers/dependencies.rb</tt> with something like

  require "lib/api"

Finally, you can set up the API routing. Open <tt>config/routes.rb</tt> and add the following line:

  mount Rack::API => "/"

If you define your API by inheriting from the Rack::API class, remember to mount your class instead.

  mount MyAPI => "/"

For additional examples, see https://github.com/fnando/rack-api/tree/master/examples.

=== Using RSpec with Rack::API

You can easily test Rack::API apps by using Rack::Test. This applies to both RSpec and Test Unit. See what you need to do if you want to use it with RSpec.

First, open your <tt>spec/spec_helper.rb</tt> and add something like this:

  require "rspec"
  require "rack/test"

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.include Rack::Test::Methods
  end

Then you can go to your spec file, say, <tt>spec/api_spec.rb</tt>. You need to define a helper method called +app+, which will point to your Rack::API (the class itself or your own class).

  require "spec_helper"

  describe Rack::API do
    # Remember to use your own class if you
    # inherited from Rack::API
    def app; Rack::API; end

    it "renders status page" do
      get "/api/v1/status"
      last_response.body.should == {:status => "running"}.to_json
      last_response.status.should == 200
    end
  end

If you want to do expectations over basic authentication, you'll have some like this:

  require "spec_helper"

  describe Rack::API do
    def basic_auth(username, password)
      "Basic " + Base64.encode64("#{username}:#{password}")
    end

    it "requires authentication" do
      get "/api/v1/status"
      last_response.status.should == 401
    end

    it "grants access" do
      get "/api/v1/status", {"HTTP_AUTHORIZATION" => basic_auth("john", "test")}
      last_response.status.should == 200
    end
  end

To reduce duplication, you can move both <tt>basic_auth</tt> and <tt>app</tt> methods to a module, which will be included on RSpec.

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.include Rack::Test::Methods
    config.include Helpers
  end

Your <tt>Helpers</tt> module may look like this:

  module Helpers
    def app
      Rack::API
    end

    def basic_auth(username, password)
      "Basic " + Base64.encode64("#{username}:#{password}")
    end
  end

== Helpers

Every Rack::API action has several helper methods available through the
Rack::API::Controller class. Here's some of them:

=== logger

Logs specified message to the STDOUT.

  get "/" do
    logger.info "Hello index page!"
    {}
  end

=== headers

Define custom headers that will be sent to the client.

  get "/" do
    headers["X-Awesome"] = "U R Awesome"
    {}
  end

== params

Return current request parameters.

  get "/" do
    {:message => "Hello #{params[:name]}"}
  end

== request

Return an object relative to the current request.

== credentials

This method will return an array container both username and password if client
sent Basic Authentication headers.

  get "/" do
    user, pass = credentials
    {:message => "Hello #{user}"}
  end

== url_for

Build an URL by merging segments, default URL options and hash with parameters.

  Rack::API.app do
    default_url_options :host => "example.com", :protocol => "https"

    version "v1" do
      get "/" do
        {:url => url_for(:users, User.find(params[:id])), :format => :json}
      end
    end
  end

== Useful middlewares

=== Rack::API::Middleware::SSL

This middleware will accept only HTTPS requests. Any request over HTTP will be dropped.

  Rack::API.app do
    use Rack::API::Middleware::SSL
  end

=== Rack::API::Middleware::Limit

This middleware will limit access to API based on requests per hour. It requires a Redis connection.

  Rack::API.app do
    # Use the default settings.
    # Will accept 60 requests/hour limited by IP address (REMOTE_ADDR)
    use Rack::API::Middleware::Limit, :with => Redis.new
  end

Other usages:

  # Set custom limit/hour.
  # Will accept Â± 1 request/second.
  use Rack::API::Middleware::Limit, :with => $redis, :limit => 3600

  # Set custom string key.
  # Will limit by something like env["X-Forwarded-For"].
  use Rack::API::Middleware::Limit, :with => $redis, :key => "X-Forwarded-For"

  # Set custom block key.
  # Will limit by credential (Basic Auth).
  Rack::API.app do
    basic_auth do |user, pass|
      User.authorize(user, pass)
    end

    use Rack::API::Middleware::Limit, :with => $redis, :key => proc {|env|
      request = Rack::Auth::Basic::Request.new(env)
      request.credentials[0]
    }
  end
